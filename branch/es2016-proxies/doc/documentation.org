#+TITLE: Using JSExplain

*** TODO Generic explanatory text here

* Overview

The JSExplain graphical user interface is presented in Figure
[[fig:000_Overall]]. It allows the users to load JavaScript programs and
execute them in our JavaScript interpreter. The users have at their
disposal a mechanism for step-by-step execution with various levels of
granularity, exposing all of the underlying details of the execution,
as described in the official ECMAScript standard.

The user interface consists of six components, as shown in Figure [[fig:001_Breakdown]]. These components are:
1. *Program selection*, where users can choose the program that they wish to execute
2. *Current program*, where the program that is currently being executed is displayed
3. *State of the program heap*, where the contents of the program heap at the current point in the execution of the program are displayed
4. *Navigation panel*, which allows the users to step through the program
5. *Interpreter*, displaying the part of the interpreter code that is active at the current point in the execution of the program
6. *State of the interpreter*, where the state of the interpreter at the current point in the execution of the program is displayed
